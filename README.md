# PyBer_Analysis

## Analysis Overview
The purpose of the new analysis is to break down the ride-sharing data by city type, then analysis the data and create a multiple-line graph showing the total weekly fares for each citytype. Finally we will summarize the data that we collected, show how it differs per city type, and describe how decision-makers at PyBer can utilize this information update and gorw their business.

## Results
As the images below show the urban city areas bring in the most amount of total fares followed in succession by the suburban areas and rural areas. This is likely due to there being a higher abundance of total rides and drivers in the urban areas. When we look at the average fare per ride, we see that the rider on average pays more in the rural area compared to the suburban and urban areas. This is most likely because the number of drivers in those areas are less than the total number of riders. Finally, when we look at the average fare per driver, we see that again the rural area is leading followed by the suburban, and urban areas. This relation is most likely due to there being less drivers and more riders in the rural areas; but as the number of drivers increases, even with an increase in riders, in the suburban and urban areas we see a decrease in the average amount that the drivers receive.

## Summary
In summation we would recommend that the decision-makers are PyBer implement some changes to decrease disparities among the city types, such as:
- giving incentives to riders in rural areas to increase that areas overall profit.
- direct some of the drivers from the urban area to the rural and suburban areas to spread out the ratio of drivers to riders better.
- adding a tip option for the driver could also help close the gap on drivers income, as well as potentially showing what drivers are the highest performers.
